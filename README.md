Script to analyse intensity and area of muscle attachment sites

Files should be labelled by consequent numbers starting with 1 (i.e. 1,2,3,4...)

Output file All.csv contains information about every individual
attachment site, whereas Average.csv contains avarage values per embryo.
The output files will be saved in the same folder as image files.

Embryos should be imaged being aligned along X-axis (with respect to 
anterior-posterior axis)

The script should work on any type of images, but I have tested only on
Olympus Upright .oib files.
